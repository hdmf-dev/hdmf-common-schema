hdmf-common Release Notes
=========================

1.9.0 (Upcoming)
----------------------
- Change the dtype of `ElementIdentifiers` and `DynamicTableRegion` from "int" to "int32". Under HDMF
  schema language 2.x, "int" means "int32" so this change has no functional impact, except when displaying the 
  spec, such as in error messages.

1.8.0 (August 4, 2023)
----------------------
- No change in the hdmf-common namespace. See :ref:`here <hdmf_experimental_release_notes>` for changes to the
  hdmf-experimental namespace.

1.7.0 (June 22, 2023)
---------------------
- No change in the hdmf-common namespace. See :ref:`here <hdmf_experimental_release_notes>` for changes to the
  hdmf-experimental namespace.

1.6.0 (May 3, 2023)
-------------------
- No change in the hdmf-common namespace. See :ref:`here <hdmf_experimental_release_notes>` for changes to the
  hdmf-experimental namespace.

1.5.1 (January 10, 2022)
------------------------
- No change in the hdmf-common namespace. See :ref:`here <hdmf_experimental_release_notes>` for changes to the
  hdmf-experimental namespace.

1.5.0 (April 19, 2021)
----------------------
- Added ``AlignedDynamicTable``, which defines a ``DynamicTable`` that supports storing a collection of sub-tables.
  Each sub-table is itself a ``DynamicTable`` that is aligned with the main table by row index. Each sub-table
  defines a sub-category in the main table effectively creating a table with sub-headings to organize columns.

1.4.0 (March 29, 2021)
-------------------------

Summary: In 1.4.0, the HDMF-experimental namespace was added, which includes the ``ExternalResources`` and ``EnumData``
data types. Schema in the HDMF-experimental namespace are experimental and subject to breaking changes at any time.
``ExternalResources`` was changed to support storing both names and URIs for resources. The ``VocabData`` data type was
replaced by ``EnumData`` to provide more flexible support for data from a set of fixed values.

- Added ``EnumData`` for storing data that comes from a set of fixed values. This replaces ``VocabData`` which could
  hold only string values. Also, ``VocabData`` could hold only a limited number of elements (~64k) when used with the
  HDF5 storage backend. ``EnumData`` gets around these restrictions by using an untyped dataset (VectorData) instead of
  a string attribute to hold the enumerated values.
- Removed ``VocabData``.
- Renamed the "resources" table in ``ExternalResources`` to "entities".
- Created a new "resources" table to store the name and URI of the ontology / external resource used by the "entities"
  table in ``ExternalResources``.
- Renamed fields in ``ExternalResources``.
- Added "entities" dataset to ``ExternalResources``. This is a row-based table dataset to replace the functionality of
  the "resources" dataset in ``ExternalResources``.
- Changed the "resources" dataset in ``ExternalResources`` to store the name and URI of the ontology / external
  resource used by the "entities" dataset in ``ExternalResources``.
- Added HDMF-experimental namespace.
- Moved ``ExternalResources`` and ``EnumData`` to HDMF-experimental.

1.3.0 (December 2, 2020)
-------------------------

- Add data type ``ExternalResources`` for storing ontology information / external resource references. NOTE: this
  data type is in beta testing and is subject to change in a later version.
- Changed dtype for datasets within ``CSRMatrix`` from 'int' to 'uint'. Negative values do not make sense for these
  datasets.

1.2.1 (November 4, 2020)
------------------------

- Update software process documentation for maintainers.
- Fix missing data_type_inc for ``CSRMatrix``. It now has ``data_type_inc: Container``.
- Add ``hdmf-schema-language`` comment at the top of each yaml file.
- Add ``SimpleMultiContainer``, a Container for storing other Container and Data objects together

1.2.0 (July 10, 2020)
------------------------

- Add software process documentation.
- Fix missing dtype for ``VectorIndex``.
- Add new ``VocabData`` data type.
- Move ``Data``, ``Index``, and ``Container`` to base.yaml. This change does not functionally change the schema.
- ``VectorIndex`` now extends ``VectorData`` instead of ``Index``. This change allows ``VectorIndex`` to index other
  ``VectorIndex`` types.
- The ``Index`` data type is now unused and has been removed.
- Fix documentation for ragged arrays.

1.1.3 (January 21, 2020)
------------------------

- Fix missing 'shape' and 'dims' key for types ``VectorData``, ``VectorIndex``, and ``DynamicTableRegion``.

1.1.2 (January 9, 2020)
-----------------------

- Fix version number in namespace.yaml and docs

1.1.1 (January 9, 2020)
-----------------------

- Support for ReadTheDocs continuous documentation was added, and legal/license documents were also added. The schema is
  unchanged.

1.1.0 (January 3, 2020)
-----------------------

- The 'colnames' attribute of ``DynamicTable`` changed from data type 'ascii' to 'text'.
- Improved documentation and type docstrings.

1.0.0 (September 26, 2019)
--------------------------

Initial release.
